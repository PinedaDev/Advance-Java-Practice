# Coding challenges

Solve one or both of the challenges.

## Challenge 1

### Create a program that takes a list of employee objects as input and sorts the list based on employee ID or employee name. Use appropriate collection data structures for storing the input and output data.

#### Details

**Objective:** The goal of this challenge is to create a program that takes a list of employee objects as input, sorts the list based on either employee ID or employee name, and outputs the sorted list. The program should utilize appropriate collection data structures for storing the input and output data.

**Input:** The input will be a list of employee objects. Each employee object should contain the following attributes:

**Employee ID:** A unique integer identifier for each employee.
Employee name: A string representing the full name of the employee.
Output: The output should be a sorted list of employee objects, either by employee ID or employee name, depending on the user's choice.

**Output:** The output should be a sorted list of employee objects, either by employee ID or employee name, depending on the user's choice.

## Challenge 2

### Write an algorithm that simulates a basic recommendation system for movies or books. The algorithm should take a list of items and a user's preferences as input and output a list of recommended items.

**Objective:** The goal of this challenge is to create a Java program that simulates a basic recommendation system for movies or books. The algorithm should take a list of items and a user's preferences as input and output a list of recommended items.

**Input:**
List of items: A list of movies or books, each represented as an object with relevant attributes (e.g., title, genre, director/author, release year/publication date, etc.).
User preferences: A set of preferences for the user, which can include preferred genres, minimum release year/publication date, favorite directors/authors, etc.

**Output:** A list of recommended items, sorted by their relevance to the user's preferences
